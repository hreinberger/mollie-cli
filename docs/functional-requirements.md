# Functional Requirements Document — Mollie CLI

## Overview

`mollie-cli` is a command-line interface aimed at developers building integrations with the [Mollie](https://www.mollie.com/) payment platform. It wraps the Mollie REST API and provides ergonomic commands for creating, inspecting, and managing Mollie resources without having to craft raw HTTP requests or write throwaway scripts.

The primary user persona is a **backend developer** who is actively integrating Mollie into an application and needs to quickly create test data, inspect live or test resources, debug webhook flows, and validate their integration logic from the terminal.

---

## Design Principles

- **Developer-first UX** — Commands should be obvious, flags should be self-documenting (`--help` is always accurate), and output should be easy to pipe into other tools.
- **Test-mode by default** — All commands run against Mollie's test environment unless `--live` is explicitly passed (or `MOLLIE_LIVE_MODE=true` is set). This prevents accidental mutations on live data during development.
- **Safe by default** — Destructive operations (delete, cancel, revoke) require explicit confirmation or a `--confirm` flag.
- **Composable output** — Default output is a human-readable table. `--output json` emits clean JSON for use with tools like `jq`.
- **Config over repetition** — Credentials, default profile IDs, and test-mode preference are stored in a config file so they need not be supplied on every invocation.

---

## Milestones

### Milestone 1 — Foundation & Authentication

The first milestone lays the groundwork that every subsequent command depends on.

#### Goals
- Project scaffolding (repository structure, module, CI skeleton).
- First-run experience: detect missing credentials and prompt the user to configure them interactively.
- Persistent configuration storage.
- Global flags available on every command.

#### Features

**1.1 First-run setup (`mollie auth setup`)**
- Detect on startup whether an API key is already configured.
- If not, show a clear, friendly prompt asking the user to paste their Organization Access Token (format `access_*`).
- Validate the token with a lightweight API call (`GET /v2/organizations/me`) before storing it.
- Inform the user where the config file was written.

**1.2 Config management (`mollie auth`)**
- `mollie auth setup` — Interactive first-run flow (see above).
- `mollie auth status` — Show the currently configured token (masked, e.g. `access_****xyz`), the active profile ID (if set), and whether live mode is enabled (test mode is the default).
- `mollie auth clear` — Remove stored credentials.

**1.3 Configuration file**
- Stored at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mollie-cli/config.toml` (fallback: `~/.config/mollie-cli/config.toml`).
- Fields: `api_key`, `profile_id` (optional), `live_mode` (default: `false`), `default_output` (default: `table`).

**1.4 Global flags (all commands)**

| Flag | Short | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--live` | `-l` | Run against the live Mollie environment. By default all commands run in test mode. |
| `--output <format>` | `-o` | Output format: `table` (default), `json`, `yaml`. |
| `--profile <id>` | | Override the profile ID for this invocation. |
| `--api-key <key>` | | Override the stored API key for this invocation. |
| `--no-color` | | Disable ANSI color output. |

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Running any command without a configured API key shows a clear error with instructions to run `mollie auth setup`.
- Running `mollie auth setup` with an invalid token shows an error and does **not** persist the key.
- Config file is created with restrictive file permissions (`0600`).
- Commands running in test mode display a subtle `[TEST]` indicator in table output so the active environment is always unambiguous.

**Acceptance Criteria**

### Milestone 7 — Developer Experience Improvements

This milestone focuses entirely on quality-of-life improvements rather than new API surface.

#### Tab Autocompletion
- Generate shell completion scripts for `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, and PowerShell via `mollie completion <shell>`.
- Completions cover subcommands and static flag values (e.g. `--output` completing to `json`, `table`, `yaml`; `--currency` completing to common ISO 4217 codes).

#### Interactive Mode
- For create/update commands, if required flags are not provided, drop into an interactive prompt-based flow using a TUI library.
- Allow `--interactive` / `-i` to force the interactive flow even when flags are provided.

#### Output Enhancements
- `--output yaml` support alongside existing `table` and `json`.
- Wide table format with `--wide` flag that shows additional columns hidden by default.
- `--quiet` / `-q` flag that suppresses all output except the resource ID (useful in scripts).

#### Configuration Profiles
- Support multiple named configurations (e.g. `staging`, `production`) via `mollie config use <profile-name>`.
- Config file groups credentials and defaults under named sections.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Completion script can be sourced and provides completions in all supported shells.
- `--quiet` on a create command outputs only the created resource's ID and exits with code 0.

---

### Milestone 8 — Future / TBD

The following areas are identified for future exploration and will be scoped in detail as earlier milestones are completed.

- **Mollie Connect / OAuth tooling** — Commands for managing clients, client links, and partner status, targeting ISVs and platforms built on top of Mollie. With automatic access token renewal
- **Terminals (Point of Sale)** — List and inspect POS terminals.
- **Sales Invoices** — Full CRUD for the Sales Invoices API.
- **Onboarding** — Get onboarding status and submit onboarding data on behalf of a client.
- **Capabilities** — List capabilities for an account.
- **Delayed Routing** — Create and inspect payment routes.
- **Diff / watch mode** — `mollie payments watch <id>` polls and displays live status changes for a payment, useful during integration testing.
- **Import / seed commands** — Bulk-create test data (customers, payments) from a JSON or YAML seed file, enabling repeatable test environments.
- **OpenTelemetry tracing** — Optional structured trace output for debugging latency in API calls.
- **Replay mode** - Pipe or open a file containing JSON and use it as the base for a Mollie API call
